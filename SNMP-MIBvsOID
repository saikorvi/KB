OID - Object Identifier
MIB - Management Information Base

What's the difference between OID & MIB?
> Simply put, an OID is a code string that represents some value. For example: you have an interface Eth0/0. This interface has some characteristics like MTU, Bandwidth, Packet count, Error count etc. Each of these
can be represented by a numeric value.

MTU  1500
Bandwidth  10000
Packets  25000
Errors  1440

Each of these values can be queried or read using a specific OID. For example MTU could be linked to OID: 2.3.1.5.1.5.1.2.2.3.2.2.2.3.2.1.

And MIB is just a database of all available OIDs for the device, describing which OID is linked to what value.
